## Setup & Running

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (or use the included Gradle wrapper)
- A Firebase project with a Realtime Database and a service account key

### Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a project, and enable Realtime Database.
2. Download your `serviceAccountKey.json` and place it in:
   - `app/src/main/resources/serviceAccountKey.json`

### Build & Run

**From the command line:**

```sh
cd app
./gradlew build
```

**To run the app:**

```sh
./gradlew run
```

**To create an executable JAR:**

```sh
./gradlew jar
```

The JAR will be in `app/build/libs/`. You can double-click it (if Java is installed and associated with `.jar` files) or run:

```sh
java -jar build/libs/app.jar
```

## Usage

- **Login**: Use your email and password to log in.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Add clients, assign clients, and view all clients.
- **Rep Dashboard**: View assigned clients and mark assignments as complete.
- **Import Clients**: Use the "Add Clients By CSV" feature to bulk import clients.
